CacheSystem
Overview
The CacheSystem is a dynamic multilevel cache management system built using React. It allows users to create multiple cache levels with different eviction policies (LRU and LFU), insert and retrieve data, and manage cache levels interactively.

Features
Dynamic Cache Levels: Add cache levels with specified sizes and eviction policies.
Eviction Policies: Supports Least Recently Used (LRU) and Least Frequently Used (LFU) eviction strategies.
Data Insertion: Insert data into the cache and handle eviction when the cache exceeds its size.
Data Retrieval: Retrieve data from the cache and update access data accordingly.
Responsive Design: Adaptable layout for different screen sizes, providing a user-friendly experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
